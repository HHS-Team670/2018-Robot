--------------------------
**Robot Code**

- [ ] Intake/Shooter
  - [ ] Basic motor activation (Control from operator joystick)
- [ ] Climber
  - [ ] Motor Activation (Controlling from operator joystick)
  - [ ] Vision alignment with the central position
- [ ] Camera
  - [ ] Program subsystem from robot (On roborio)
  - [ ] Align with the climber using vision processing 

**Sensors/Inputs**
NOTE: Remember your try catches, in case the robot sensor is unplugged

- [ ] Elevator
  - [ ] Choose sensor (Laser/Ultrasonic/BNO055)
  - [ ] Once chosen, program in Elevator subsystem
- [ ] navXMicro
  - [ ] DriveStraight
  - [ ] Pivoting procedures
- [ ] Vision
    - If offboard processor:
        - [ ] Detect box location, and pickup
        - [ ] Do 3d modeling
        - [ ] Send command to network tables to the robot/serial connection
    - If Onboard Roborio (as command)
        - [ ] Detect box location, and pickup

**Autonomous Code**

- [X] Do Nothing Command
- [ ] Left Side
  - [ ] Logic Portion (Decisioning process)
  - [ ] Complete schematic to approach, and place box, with ultrasonic input
- [ ] Right Side
  - [ ] Logic Portion (Decisioning process)
  - [ ] Complete schematic to approach, and place box, with ultrasonic input
- [ ] Center
  - [ ] Go for baseline
  - [ ] ~~IF navXMicro works~~
       - [ ] ~~Complete schematic to approach, and place box, with ultrasonic input~~
	-[ ] ~After Everything~ Waypoint Pathfinding
